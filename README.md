# MERN Application Using Pokemon API and Authentication

### About
This full stack web application can be used to help users find a "PokéPal" based on their mood. Users can sign up for an account and must be logged in to have full access to the website. Once authenticated, users can complete a survey to "catch" a Pokémon, which gets stored in their "Pokéball" while they remain on the site. 

More details can be found within the README of the server and client side applications.
